  Nx-powered Neural Networks.

  Axon provides a high-level interface for creating neural
  networks in Elixir. Axon is built entirely on top of Nx
  numerical definitions, so every neural network can be
  JIT or AOT compiled using any Nx compiler, or even
  transformed into high-level neural network formats
  like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX.
